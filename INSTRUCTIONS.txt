Firstly, Be on linux
Secondly, install prism launcher
Thirdly, make an instance of prism called HARDER and install litematica, baritone, minescript 5 beta, or just latest, minecraft 1.21.5, fabric, meteor (for freecam), and whatever else you want on there.
Fourthly, install nbdkit for your version of linux, make sure you get the nessesary components to run the python module of it.
Fifthly, Put the config.txt, and nbd.py files in the minescript folder of your HARDER instance.
Sixthly, Edit the start.sh script where it starts prism to open up the server or whatever of your choosing
Seventhly, edit nbd.py to have your desired chunks set.
Seven and a halfthly, pip install mcschematic for the specific version of python that minescript uses.
Eighthly, run the start.sh script, and wait for it to finish. It should start the minecraft instance and open the server or whatever, and then say "waiting for command"
Ninthly, run the format.sh script, and wait for it to finish. It should format the drive.
If you attempt to mount the drive normally through dolphin it will do odd shit and write a whole bunch to disk and time out, so mount it by using
sudo mount /dev/nbd0 /run/media/*uruser*/HARDERDRIVE for fedora kde or whatever the equivilent thing is for your os
it should now appear in your file explorer, place files in it, and baritone will build them. I would reccomend doing all interaction with it through terminal, though, or youll get unexpected writes that take fucking forever :[ 
whenever u feel like run ./stop.sh to stop the drive, it wont stop mc tho so manually take care of that
