I just managed to remember that we cannot in fact store an entire byte inside of one block, meaning the filesystem cannot be in one single chunk. fuck.
had to manually drag mcschematic into a folder that minescript can see it lol

8/7/25 - nvm just use a command to install stuff specifically for the correct version of python
i built out quite a few of the functions today, and built the architechture for writing in excalidraw

8/8/25 - dealing with 2 different undebuggable python scripts is going to be a nightmare lmao
potential issue: i need to make sure that the layers returning functionality actually works and clears nessesary layers before adding more data
i think it should be able to stream the data to the client, but i'm not sure how to do that, seems a bit hard with the current project structure.
also god youd think that reading the data would be fast but its so god damn slow holy shit bro
theoretically, absolutely everything just works, but theres no shot. im formatting it now.
reading and writing seemingly worked the first time i ran it... it no longer appears to work... i have no idea what's going on
oh my goodness it work!!!!!!!! it freaking works
im gonnan go make some files to store on it and then tommorow i can put it on 2b2t or that other anarchy server lol ive never played anarchy really except i had a base on like 8b8t or some shit like that
i need to have it alert me when
